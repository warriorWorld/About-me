# About-me
An introduction about myself

Okay, in this repo, I will introduce my work experiences. For obvious reasons, my GitHub only includes my personal projects(I definitely cannot upload my companies' projects here, so all those projects I will not put project links here).

## Company projects
I've been working for three companies during my 8 years of working as an Android developer, I will describe them in an inverted order.

This app is only available on specific devices, you can check it out by clicking [here](https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1756802320950561258&wfr=spider&for=pc).

This app is kind of like Siri, you can talk with it and it will answer you by voice. You can ask specific questions, such as how to write a Chinese word, and it will show you how by showing a gif, or you can ask the app to play a piece of music for you. Or you can just chat with it about everyday topics.

95% of this app was developed by me(of course I mean the Android part).
