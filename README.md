# About-me
An introduction about myself

Okay, in this repo, I will introduce my work experiences. For obvious reasons, my GitHub only includes my personal projects(I definitely cannot upload my companies' projects here, so all those projects I will not put project links here).

## Company projects
I've been working for three companies during my 8 years of working as an Android developer, I will describe them in an inverted order.
